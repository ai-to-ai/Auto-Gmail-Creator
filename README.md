### Introduction

This is the automation script for Python lovers to learn basics about automation as well as commercial for marketers.

According to [Jonathan](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jonathan-Elder)'s desription ,only about five gmail addresses can be verified on a single phone number.

This script uses [sms-activate.org](https://sms-activate.org) api for phone verification and more services will be added.

To run the script, you don't need to download Chromedriver or Geckodriver manually. The script does it automatically with webdriver manager.


You can customize this script to avoid getting blocked. I am also developing another script with Requests but going to keep it private since it will be blocked if I let it public.

Also, Feel free to contact me if you have any project regarding Automation, Scraping, Machine Learning.

## Usage
1. Install Python 3.x.
2. ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` 
3. ```python app.py```
4. 'Created.txt' will be generated for successful creation.
5. if you already installed python packages for my previous script, I recommend to upgrade the ```webdriver-manager``` package by ```pip install webdriver-manager -U```

## Customize
### Browser [ Chrome, Firefox ]
Switch from Chrome to Firefox by commenting 2 lines.
```
#options = ChromeOptions()
options = FirefoxOptions()

#driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()), options = options, seleniumwire_options=seleniumwire_options)

driver = webdriver.Firefox(service=Service(GeckoDriverManager().install()), options = options, seleniumwire_options=seleniumwire_options)

```
### Manual or Automatic User info generation
You edit the 'User.csv' with given type such as First name, Last name, Password, Birthday, Username(optional) from the second line.
If the 5th parameter on user.csv is not passed by userBot generates username automatically adding FN + dot + LN + random 5 digits.(john.doe12345@gmail.com)
Thanks to [BourneXu](https://github.com/BourneXu/AutoCreateGmailAccount), Script generates random popular usernames.
You can set this variant as "True" to use this functionality to automate generation.
```
AUTO_GENERATE_UERINFO = True
```
### Proxy
If you want to use socks proxy, please remove comment theses lines.
[Free Proxy list](http://free-proxy.cz/en/proxylist/country/all/socks5/ping/all/2) is here

    SOCKS_PROXY = "socks5://user:pass@ip:port"
```

### Headless or With UI (Optional)

    options.add_argument(r'--profile-directory=ProfileName')
